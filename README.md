## Introduction

Welcome to the Gesture Detection project! This project aims to detect and recognize gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Gestures can be used for various applications, such as sign language recognition, human-computer interaction, and more.

The project provides a framework for capturing live video feed from a camera, processing the frames to detect gestures, and providing real-time feedback or recognition results.
